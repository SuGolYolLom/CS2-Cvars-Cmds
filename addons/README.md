# **Disclaimer**: This is the alternate version of code that is based on the 'saul/cvar-unhide-s2' repository, that I used to generate the fake cvarlist.log, which can be found [here](https://github.com/saul/cvar-unhide-s2). I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the original creator, [saul](https://github.com/saul), for their valuable work and contribution to the open-source community.
